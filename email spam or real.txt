✅ Answer Key — Real vs Fake (with red-flag mapping)

Email 1 — Real
Why: Familiar sender domain that matches company internal portal (assumed), specific account digits and contextual detail; reasonable link to an internal portal (no pressure or unusual requests). (Safe)

Email 2 — Fake
Why: Suspicious sender domain (fedex-delivery.com vs official FedEx), unknown URL with non-FedEx domain and urgent reschedule request → red flags #2 (phone/identity doesn’t check), #3 (unknown links), #8 (urgency).

Email 3 — Real
Why: Short verification code with clear, expected format and reputable domain link (accounts.google.com). No request for the user to reply with the code. (Safe)

Email 4 — Fake
Why: Unsolicited prize, random selection, unknown claim URL — classic “free stuff” lure. (Red flag #5)

Email 5 — Real
Why: Specific invoice number, recognizable local utility sender, receipt context; no asking for sensitive info or suspicious link. (Safe)

Email 6 — Fake
Why: Generic “Dear Customer”, threatening suspension, and a non-bank URL. Poses as financial institution to frighten user into action. (Red flags #6 generic greeting, #8 urgency, #9 financial claim)

Email 7 — Fake
Why: Asks for passport number by reply (sensitive PII) and promises free travel — high-risk and unsolicited. (Red flags #5 free stuff, #7 wrong-number/social-engineer style requests for identity)

Email 8 — Real (assuming the link domain matches Grab’s official domain)
Why: Context-specific (driver name, trip tracking) and plausible service link. If the URL domain is exactly the official service domain, this is legitimate; always verify domain. (Safe — but check the exact domain string.)

Email 9 — Real
Why: Local studio reminder, gives clear opt-out (“Reply ‘CANCEL’”), reasonable link to class page. Non-threatening and expected. (Safe)

Email 10 — Fake
Why: Alarmist language, asks to click an unfamiliar domain to “fix” device — impersonates a major vendor to cause panic. (Red flags #6 generic greeting, #8 urgency, #9 impersonates financial/tech institution)
