Why Do Data Breaches Keep Happening?
Data breaches continue to occur due to a combination of factors:

Increasing Sophistication of Cyberattacks: Attackers are constantly developing new methods to bypass security measures, utilizing advanced techniques like AI-driven phishing and zero-day exploits.

Human Error and Insider Threats: Employees may unintentionally expose data through negligent actions or may act maliciously due to various motivations.

Expanded Attack Surface: The rise of remote work and cloud services has expanded the potential entry points for attackers. Employees accessing sensitive data from unsecured networks or personal devices increase the risk.

Value of Data on the Dark Web: Stolen data is highly valuable on black markets, incentivizing cybercriminals to target organizations with rich data stores.

Inadequate Security Measures: Some organizations fail to keep up with evolving security threats, neglecting updates, and not investing sufficiently in cybersecurity infrastructure and training.
